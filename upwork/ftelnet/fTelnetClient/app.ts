// TODO List:
// Add option to automatically reconnect (maybe via two options: reconnect interval, and reconnect count)
// Sequence to clear a region
// Mo's MUD has a display issue that isn't present in SyncTerm
// Split fTelnet.ts up into smaller chunks (ie maybe separate class for menu buttons that raise events on click)
// Maybe underline detected hyperlinks?
// Add version number displayed to user somewhere (menu popup?)
// Maybe have OnWindowMouseUp handle hiding the menu if it's popped up
// Make scrollback size configurable
// RIP fonts need to be optimized
// Add option to play <audio> when connect is clicked (maybe also when connected and disconnected?)

// nano uses ascii 15 (shift in) -- might need an option to say "don't print these control characters" and then let the sysop list the characters to ignore
//                                 or maybe just a "don't print control characters" option, which will ignore all of them
